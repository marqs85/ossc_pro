 * alt_busy_sleep.c - Microsecond delay routine which uses a calibrated busy
 *                    loop to perform the delay. This is used to implement
 *                    usleep for both uC/OS-II and the standalone HAL.
 *
 * Author PRR
 *
 * Calibrated delay with no timer required
 *
 * The ASM instructions in the routine are equivalent to
 *
 * for (i=0;i<us*(ALT_CPU_FREQ/3);i++);
 *
 * and takes three cycles each time around the loop
